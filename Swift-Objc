1. Objc has variables declarations with type mentioned
 
 NSString *str = "Reckon"
 const int num = 10;
 
Swift doesn't need to have type declared. type is inferred from the values so it is strongly typed language.
 
 var name = "Reckon"
 let number = 10
 
 
2.Objc - all are reference types(string, arrays, dictionaries, collections, blocks, dispatch queues) all are built by classes 
swift - all are value types(strings, arrays, dictionaries) are built by structs except closures, dispatch queues

3.Objc has Categories
Swift had Extensions

4.Objc has no protocols support on Enums or structs
Swift has support of protocols on Enums or structs.

5. Swift has tuples, Optionals, higher order functions which objc does not have.
  
6. Objc objects are created using malloc

  NewClass a* = [[NewClass malloc] init]
  
  In Siwft
  
  let a = NewClass()
  
7. Swift supports Computed properties where proeprties can be computed when accessed. It also supports property observers.

   var name: String {
         didSet { // property observer
             label.text = name
         }
   }
   
   var name: String {
           get { return name }
           set {   label.text = newValue }
   }
   
 8. As optioanls are supported in Swift. It supports Nil coalescing
 
          var value: String? = nil
          var actualValue = value ?? "default" . // if value is nil then set default value
          
    It also supports optional chaining, binding
    
    struct Person { var name: String }
    var person: Person? = nil
    person?.name . // using ? after the variable provides the ability of the values exists then it unwraps it
    
    
    If let person = person {
        print(person.name)
    }
    
    guard let person = person else {
          return
    }
    print(person.name)
    
  9. Siwt arrays dictionaries, collections have copy on write feature to improve performance of value types

     func address(_ o: UnsafeRawPointer ) {
         print(String(format: "%p", Int(bitPattern: o)))
     }

     var array1: [Int] = [0, 1, 2, 3]
     var array2 = array1

     print("array1... \(address(array1))") //0x600000078de0
     print("array2... \(address(array2))")  //0x600000078de0
     //Let's mutate array2 to see what's
     array2.append(4)

     print("array2 changed address ... \(address(array2))")  //0x6000000aa100
     
  10.  If we want a class to have variable publicly accessed but not override in other classes other than its own.
  
       Swift:-  
         class Person {
            private(set) var name?
            init(value: String) {
              name = value
            }
         }
      
      Objc:-
       
      Interface file Person.h
      @interface Person: NSObject {
          @property(nonatomic, readonly) NSString *name;
      }
      
      Implementation file Person.m
      
      @interface Person() {
       @property(nonatomic,readwrite) NSString *name;
      }
       
      @implementation
      
      @end
     
    11. The we implement optionals in objective-c is as below (https://useyourloaf.com/blog/using-nullable-to-annotate-objective-c/)
    
            Marking types as nonnull imports them as non-optional in Swift. 
            Marking types as nullable imports them as optional in Swift.
            
          objc:-  @property (nonnull,copy,readonly) NSString *name;
          swift: public var name: String { get }
          
          objc:-  @property (nullable,copy,readonly) NSString *name;
          swift: public var name: String? { get }
         
          objc:-  - (nullable instancetype)initWithName:(nonnull NSString *)name;
          swift:- public init?(name: String)

          To Make complete block Non Null.
          
            NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN
            @interface Robot : NSObject
            @property (copy,readonly) NSString *name;
            - (nullable instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name;
            - (nullable NSString *)tellMeSomething;
            @end
            NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END
            
          
    12. Objc does not support method overloading.
      -(NSString*) getName:(NSString *) id forParent:(NSString *) parent;
      -(NSString*) getName:(NSString *) id forParent:(NSString *) parent1;
         getName, forParent can not be same.
         
         Swift supports method overloading.

   13. when we declare a delegate variable in Objective c. we check whether the delegate object has the method implemented by
   respondsToSelector. 

          if ([delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(methodName:withEtc:)]) {
                [delegate methodName:123 withEtc:456];
          }
      
      In Swift delegate can be optional.
          delegate?.methodName(123, withETC: 456)
